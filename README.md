#### ***Welcome to our final activity!***

Everything you need to complete the activity is in the course! Feel free to go back and review the course content if you encounter any difficulties completing the activity.

**Instructions:**

* Go to the [Github website](https://github.com/OCclassprojects/superherocode) (Right now you are in the README.md file so you're on the right track!)

* Then go through the code in the ***src*** folder. The src folder will contain **basic pseudocode** for each part of the web application we need a secure design for. 

* For each page, analyze the code and decide how it can be secured.

* Using the PDF template provided, add your suggestion for each page, creating a security checklist for the web app developer.  

Here is the list of the pages that you will need to analyze and provide suggestions for!

* Login
* Cookies
* XML entities
* GET/POST requests
* URL generation
* SQL queries
* Database Encryption
* Framework vulnerabiliteis
* Lock down your web app environment!

You will be evaluated by your peers on your understanding of how to secure the web application!
