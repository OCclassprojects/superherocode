#### ***Welcome to our Final Activity!***

Everything you need to complete the activity is in the coursework!  Make sure you go back and review the course content if you have any issues.

Here are the **instructions**!

### Go to the [Github website](https://github.com/OCclassprojects/superherocode)
### Right now you are in the README.md file so you're on the right track!
### Next we will go through the code in the ***src*** folder.
### Each page on here has an element on the web application that needs to be secured!

#### Instructions: 

* The src folder will contain **basic pseudocode** for each part of the web application we need a secure design for. 

* Based off of what you learned, can you create a checklist for the web app developer?  

* You want to give the coder a list of guidelines to follow when implementing a login page on the web application!

##### Hint: you can get some ideas on the best practice lists in the course content!

You will use the **OWASPhero.pdf** file that is provided in the activity to fill out your checklist of suggestions to secure the code!

Here is the list of the pages that you will need to analyze and provide suggestions for!

* Login
* Cookies
* XML entities
* GET/POST requests
* URL generation
* SQL queries
* Database Encryption
* Framework vulnerabiliteis
* Lock down your web app environment!

 
Make sure and keep a copy of your work for your mentors!
